# Humio - AWS Quick Start

This guide will let you get started running with Humio on AWS.  It
uses AWS Cloud Formation templates and will create a single instance
of Humio with a connected data volume.

Just hit the "Launch Stack" button and follow the Create Stack Wizard.

Launch Stack for VPC: stay tuned...

## Access Control

Humio will listen for HTTP traffic on port 8080, but the template have
an option to restrict access based on IP range. For a production setup
we advise you to put a HTTPS proxy in front of Humio or place it
inside your VPC.

## Sizing

Choosing the right instance size depends on your ingest volume and
usage patterns. As a general guideline the following table is a
starting point for sizing your Humio instance.

- Up to 15 GB/day: m4.large
- Up to 35 GB/day: m4.xlarge
- Up to 75 GB/day: m4.2xlarge
- Up to 150 GB/day: m4.4xlarge
